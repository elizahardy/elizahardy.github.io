                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                    <p>The project makes a scene by using Python Turtle Graphics. I used pre-loaded functions (draw_circle, draw_rectangle, draw_square, and draw_triangle) to make more complex shapes such as stars, a moon, and a castle. By rotating and shifting shapes in the same function I was able to create these shapes.</p>

                <h2>Sample Code</h2>
                    <p>This portion of code makes the stars by combining two triangles that overlap eachother. The parameters used let the positioning of the stars to be flexibly placed around the scene.</p>

            • <strong>t</strong>: The object for drawing in turtle Graphics
                    <br>
            • <strong>x, y</strong>: Gives coordinates on where to start drawing the stars
                    <br>
            • <strong>b</strong>: Signals how many pixles to move by in a stroke

                <h2>Final Scene</h2>
                    <p>This is the compleated scene using turtle graphics. It includes a crecent moon, six stars, and a castle with two towers on a dark blue background:</p>
                    <div class="scene-container">
                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elizahardy/elizahardy.github.io/refs/heads/p9/turtle_scene.png" alt="Turtle Graphics Scene - A grey castle with two towers and a dark blue sky with a crecent moon and six yellow stars" class="scene-image">
                    </div>
                    <p class="scene-description">
                        This scene uses a variety of shapes provided by turtle to make new ones. The castle uses a rectangle and squares, the six stars use two triangles each(one of which is flipped horizontially), and the moon combines two different colored circles. All elements use layering in order to depict a better story. After running the code, a scene of a castle in the night is revealed.
